## Bugs

* I have added posts from the 'Mars Commander' blog to the Journal view of the app, but I haven't been able to figure out how to parse out the <p> tags that are included in the text due to wordpress' built in formatting. I will bring this issue up with one of the instructors during portfolio week.

## Learning Outcomes

* As an introduction to the concept of building an application entirely in the front-end using javascript-based code, this was really eye opening. I am excited to delve into this more through learning more about angular and other similar technologies.

* I think I learned quite a bit about best practices in app design through this project, as well as absorbing some basic terminology and concepts (views, components etc.) that may be applicable outside of the world of Angular.

* Although there wasn't a huge amount of CSS for this project, I got to practice writing 'dryer' SASS, as well as thinking about how styling choices affect user experience/user interface. Designing animations in order to give the user feedback, rather than just to produce an interesting look, was a fun experiment.
